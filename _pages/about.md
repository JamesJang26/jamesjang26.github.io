😁 Welcome! I am a Master's candidate at Seoul National University in the [MEDINFO Lab](https://medinfolab.snu.ac.kr/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jinwook Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=At673E8AAAAJ&hl=en). I was also a visiting student at Yale University in the [YaleNLP](https://nlp.cs.yale.edu/), advised by Professor [Arman Cohan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=baI7IY0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My primary research interests lie in **AI for Science and Medicine**, with a focus on **RAG**, **Reasoning**, **Agents**, and **Multimodal AI**. In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects such as developing a vision-based Tennis AI coaching system and a book translation agent.

My journey into AI began during my undergraduate studies in **Integrative Biotechnology** at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University). An introductory AI course opened my eyes to the world of **deep learning** and **machine learning**, and I've been captivated by this field ever since.

One of the most significant turning points in my life was my time in the [**KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the United States Army)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Augmentation_to_the_United_States_Army). It was during military service that I discovered my love for reading after picking up **Higashino Keigo's** [*"The Miracles of the Namiya General Store"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_the_Namiya_General_Store). This marked the beginning of a new routine: daily journaling, reading books, and working out—habits that dramatically changed the direction of my life.

In the future, I aspire to make **AI** a powerful tool that seamlessly integrates into our daily lives, much like **elevators** in modern buildings—something that enhances convenience and efficiency, though not always noticed. I hope to build something that will make AI a positive force for as many people as possible.

In my spare time, you'll find me enjoying **weightlifting**, **tennis**, or **reading**—my favorite ways to unwind and stay balanced. 🎾
