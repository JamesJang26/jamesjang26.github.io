Welcome to my blog! My name is **James Jang**, and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree at [Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University), primarily focusing on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using medical data. Through this blog, I share my learnings, projects, and some thoughts.

My journey into artificial intelligence began during my undergraduate studies in **Integrative Biotechnology** at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University). While contemplating my future career and what I truly wanted to pursue, I took an introductory AI course. That experience opened my eyes to the world of **deep learning** and **machine learning**, and I’ve been captivated by this field ever since. This passion led me to my current research, where I focus on medical NLP, although I also have a strong interest in **multimodal AI** and applications beyond healthcare.

One of the most significant turning points in my life was my time in the [**KATUSA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Augmentation_to_the_United_States_Army). It was during military service that I discovered my love for reading, a habit that transformed my perspective and daily life. Before enlisting, I rarely read books, but after picking up **Higashino Keigo’s** [*"The Miracles of the Namiya General Store"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_the_Namiya_General_Store) out of boredom, I was drawn into the world of books. This marked the beginning of a new routine: daily journaling, reading books, work out. These habits dramatically changed the direction of my life, instilling discipline and purpose.

In the future, I aspire to contribute to making **artificial intelligence** a powerful tool that seamlessly integrates into our daily lives, much like **elevators** in modern buildings—something that enhances convenience and efficiency, though not always noticed. As my friend and inspiration [**Shim Jaejun**](https://jjunshim.github.io/) once said, “AI will become as essential as elevators: not indispensable, but a transformative aid to our daily lives.” I fully share this vision and hope to build a company that will make AI a positive force and strong companion for as many people as possible.

While I’m committed to developing my skills and knowledge, I also believe it’s just as important to be a **kind** and **compassionate** person. I strive to lead a life where I’m both capable and warm-hearted, and although I have much to learn, I am committed to growing in this way.

In my spare time, you’ll likely find me enjoying **weightlifting**, **tennis**, or **reading**—my favorite ways to unwind and stay balanced. 

I've been playing **tennis** with my family since I was 7 years old. While I haven't received much professional training, I’ve always enjoyed playing the game. A small point of pride is that I once finished as the **runner-up** in the **USAG-Daegu tennis tournament** during my time in KATUSA. After completing my service, I joined the [**Gangnam Bulpae Tennis Club**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=L5XBMYhiGVU), part of the larger [**TennisMania**](https://cafe.naver.com/tetizen) community with nearly 5,000 members. Not only did I get to improve my skills and continue playing the sport I love, but I also took on the responsibility of being part of the club’s management team.

Much like tennis, I began skiing at a young age. Up until this year, I had only skied in South Korea, but earlier this year, I ventured out to [**Niseko, Japan**](https://www.niseko.ne.jp/en/), for my first solo ski trip abroad. This experience opened my eyes to a bigger world of skiing, and now I’m eager to explore ski resorts across the globe. It’s one of my dreams to earn enough to visit and ski at all the best resorts around the world.
